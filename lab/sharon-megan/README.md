**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are buliding a responsive website that is mobile first. When viewing on a tablet/mobile screen less than 640 the menu switches from inline to hamburger and is enabled with a mouse hover. When it is full screen on a computer the nav bar switches to full view inline.

## Getting Started
Scaffold the HTML
Style the css in SMACSS using best practices
Add media queries to show the proper display based on the users current screen size. 
Be sure all style sheets are linked.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
